								As part of the <b>F</b>riends of <b>A</b>mateur <b>R</b>ocketry, FAR, competition to
								launch a student-built rocket to 30,000 feet and return safely, I took the role of a
								structural/aerodynamics engineer for the team. Consisting of 25 people in total, I spent
								most of my time manufacturing the carbon fiber and fiber glass composite body tubes that
								make up most of the exterior of the rocket. These tubes are what allowed the rocket to
								survive its 5.5 second burn at 1300 pounds of thrust, as well as peak G-Forces of 12 g's.
							</p>
							<p>
								My other role was to design a new set of fins to withstand the near Mach 2 speeds the
								the rocket would be travelling. Due to our rocket being minimum diameter, meaning the
								motor casing was up against the skin of the rocket, the mounting system was also exposed
								to those same conditions. Any large mounting system would decrease the rockets maximum
								altitude dramatically, so the smallest, and therefore weakest, possible system was need.
							</p>
							<p>
								After a years worth of work, and many manufacturing setbacks. The rocket was brought out
								to the Mojave desert to compete at FAR. Where it won <b>First Place</b> reaching a maximum
								altitude of 23,749 feet and a maximum speed of Mach 1.78.

								In an effort to help visual problems and solutions for Vector Dynamics problems, I
								created a toolbox for the MATLAB coding language that will plot the movement given the
								equations of motion. This is accomplished by using a set of functions for each prominent
								shape that link into one another. For example, a set of two lines and two circles could
								be used to create a double pendulum.
							</p>
							<p>
								With other functions that create springs, force arrows, trails, etc., it is possible to
								create and demonstrate motion of any dynamical system given their equations of motion.
								This helps build intuition on why certain systems react in the way that they do, and can
								be a helpful tool as a gateway into the field.

							<h2>Ceres Sample Return Mission</h2>

								As part of a class project for the Orbital Dynamics course at Cal Poly Pomona, I took
								the role as Team Lead to design a mission to return a sample from the planetoid Ceres.
								In order to achieve this goal, I utilized MATLAB to generate porkchop plots (as seen
								on the left) from lambert arcs. After optimal time frames were acquired Earth-Mars
								transfers, those dates were tested for possible Mars flybys that result in an arrival
								at Ceres. Each possible trajectory was weighted with a cost function to find the best
								possible result.
							</p>
							<p>
								From there the spacecraft orbited in a sun-synchronous polar orbit while it collected
								the samples. Once that was complete, the spacecraft would follow the same trajectory
								and optimization in reverse, leaving Ceres to flyby Mars and arrive at Earth where it
								would deposit the sample.

							<h2>Wind Tunnel Testing</h2>

										Cal Poly Pomona's Supersonic Wind Tunnel
									</subtitle>
								</span>
								In order to study the effects of low speed (100 - 350 ft/s) and high speed (Mach 1.5 -
								3.6) aerodynamics, Cal Poly Pomona had a series of classes to utilize their both there
								supersonic and low speed wind tunnels. For both cases, the wind tunnels are operated by
								students with supervision from professors, and the results from each test is condensed
								into a report which is submitted for a grade.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the <b>S</b>uper<b>s</b>onic <b>W</b>ind <b>T</b>unnel (SSWT), a series of tests
								were conducted on multiple shapes (cones, spheres, wedges, etc.) while varying the
								velocity from Mach 1.5 to Mach 3.6. Environmental variables were measured such as
								pressure drop before and after the test section and on the surface of the geometry.
								Also, Schlieren photography, Shadow Graphs, were take to verify the Mach readouts from
								the wind tunnel itself.
							</p>
							<p>
								As for the <b>L</b>ow <b>S</b>peed <b>W</b>ind <b>T</b>unnel (LSWT), different airfoil
								shapes (2D and 3D) were tested to evaluate similar variables as the SSWT. One key
								difference between the tunnels is the possiblity to test aeroelasticity inside the LSWT.
								By using a wing that can change its angle of twist (at the tip and root), we can
								evaluate the different configurations in different circumstances. For example, at high
								speeds, the wing can flatten out for less drag in a cruise configuration, while at low
								speeds it can be shaped to generate more lift for landings and take-off.
